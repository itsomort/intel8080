# intel 8080 emulator

emulator for the intel 8080, usually puts readability over effeciency 

i am NOT implementing the DAA instruction and by extension not using the auxillary carry flag

io support, restarts, interrupts, halts, and pseudo instructions will be done in the far future

a simple assembler (maybe in python) will also be made to make emulation easier instead of writing them with hex codes in the `programs.h` file
